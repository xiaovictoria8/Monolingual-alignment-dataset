"We do not have a strict definition of what constitutes a correspondence. As a rule of thumb align words or phrases a->b in two sentences (A,B) whenever the words a can be substituted for b in B, or vice-versa. This relationship should hold within the context of the sentence pair in question: the relation a->b need not hold in general contexts. Trivially this definition allows for identical word pairs. The choice of aligning words or blocks can be subjective. In general, you should align the smallest possible sensible unit, which will be individual words in the majority of sentences. When the same concept has been realised in the two sentences with quite a different construction, and aligning the two word-for-word becomes infeasible, then a many-to-many block should be used. For example, a block alignment should be used in the following sentence pair:",5-1 6-2 4-0 8-4 7-3 10-9 9-8 8-7,4-0 5-1 6-2 7-4 7-3 8-3 8-4 9-3 9-4 10-10 0-7 1-5 1-6 1-8 1-9 2-5 2-6 2-8 2-9 3-5 3-6 3-8 3-9,0.625,0.21739130434782608,0.3225806451612903
"This is an example where you should use a many-to-many block to align the sentence pairs. In general, discontinuous alignments should be preferred over many-to-many alignments.

"When a word, phrase, or clause in a sentence does not have a corresponding word, phrase, or clause in its paraphrase sentence, it should be marked as new information. You can do this by highlighting the row/column corresponding to these words by clicking on the words themselves, which will make the entire row/column pink. Only word units that carry actual semantic content and represent genuinely novel information should be marked as new information.

"Proper Nouns: Consider proper noun noun phrases (NPs e.g., George Bush, the United Nations) as one semantic entity. These denote people, places, organisations, etc. These are usually obvious from the capitalisation, however we've lower-cased the data. Such entities of more than one word will be generally block aligned. Definite descriptions corresponding to proper noun NPs that are aligned to proper noun NPs should be also block aligned. The NP the secretary of state is block aligned with Condoleezza Rice in the example below. Finally, proper noun NPs can be recursive consisting of several proper noun NPs . In such cases, we recommend that you break the NP into subparts each corresponding to a proper noun NP, instead of using a block alignment for the entire NP. For example, if you were given the NP Condoleezza Rice of the United States, you should use two block alignments one for Condoleezza Rice and one for the United States.",0-1 1-3,0-0 0-1 1-0 1-1 2-0 2-1 3-0 3-1,0.5,0.125,0.2
